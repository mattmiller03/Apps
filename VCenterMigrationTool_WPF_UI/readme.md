# vCenter Migration Tool - Project Status

## Overview
This WPF application facilitates vCenter migrations from 7.x to 8.x versions. It provides a modern UI for connecting to vCenter instances, backing up configurations, migrating resources, and validating environments. The application follows MVVM principles and integrates with VMware PowerCLI for operations.

## Current State
### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Connection Management**
   - Connect to source/destination vCenters
   - Test connectivity
   - Auto-load connection profiles
   - Status display with version info
   - Disconnect functionality

2. **Backup System**
   - Configurable backup path
   - Selective component backup:
     - Virtual Distributed Switches (VDS)
     - Users and Groups
     - Roles
     - Permissions
     - Host Configurations
     - VM Configurations
     - Cluster Configurations
     - Resource Pools
     - Folders
   - Progress tracking with cancellation
   - Detailed logging

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Hierarchical tree view:
     - Datacenters
     - Clusters
     - Hosts
     - Virtual Machines
   - Dynamic inventory loading
   - Host selection for migration

4. **Migration System (Partial)**
   - Host migration preparation
   - Migration task queue
   - Progress tracking
   - Basic simulation implementation

5. **UI Components**
   - ModernWPF-styled interface
   - Tabbed navigation:
     - Connection
     - Backup Tasks
     - Migration Tasks
     - Validation
     - Activity Log
   - Resizable log panel
   - Progress indicators
   - Contextual status displays

6. **Logging System**
   - Timestamped log entries
   - Log level filtering (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - Log clearing/saving
   - Auto-scrolling
   - Debug fallback

### 🚧 In Progress/Partial Implementation
1. **Migration Features**
   - Actual host migration logic (currently simulated)
   - VM migration (stubbed)
   - Cluster migration (stubbed)
   - Batch migration operations

2. **Validation System**
   - Test selection UI
   - Results grid
   - Basic dummy validation (needs real checks)

3. **Credential Management**
   - SSO/ESXi credential storage
   - Credential testing
   - Secure storage framework

### ❌ Not Implemented
1. Restore functionality from backups
2. Actual migration execution logic
3. Comprehensive validation checks
4. Rollback mechanism
5. Report generation
6. Advanced error recovery

### Key Components
Key Dependencies
ModernWPF (UI styling)
Ookii.Dialogs.Wpf (Folder browser)
VMware.PowerCLI (vCenter operations)
System.Management.Automation (PowerShell integration)

### Technical Notes

PowerShell Integration

Managed through PowerShellRunspaceManager
All vCenter operations use PowerCLI
Fallback to simulation mode when PowerCLI unavailable
Async Operations

All long-running tasks are asynchronous
Proper cancellation support (CancellationTokenSource)
UI thread updates via Dispatcher
Security

Credentials stored using Windows Data Protection API
SecureString usage for passwords
Certificate validation for connections
Error Handling

Comprehensive try/catch blocks
User-friendly error messages
Detailed error logging
Fallback mechanisms
Next Steps
Implement Migration Logic

Integrate host migration scripts
Add VM/cluster migration
Implement rollback functionality
Enhance Validation

Add real validation checks:
Connectivity tests
Version compatibility
Resource availability
Configuration checks
Complete Credential Management

Finish credential testing logic
Implement credential-based operations
Add credential rotation
UI Improvements

Progress visualization during migrations
Result reporting
Dark/light theme support
Responsive design enhancements
Backup Restoration

Implement restore from backup functionality
Version comparison
Conflict resolution
Known Issues
Simulated migration progress (needs real implementation)
Inventory tree doesn't refresh automatically
Some backup operations not fully implemented
Validation tests are placeholders
Limited error recovery during long operations
